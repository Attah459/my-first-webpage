    <p>What Makes this such an interesting moment?</p>
    <ol>If Ken had blocked any of the attacks he would have died by chip damage, and hence parrying was his best option</ol>
    <ol>By choosing to parry, he had to give up blocking, and doing the multiple inputs are hard with tournament nerves </ol>
    <ol>If Ken did any other combo, he wouldn't have won. In such a tight scenerio, he picked the optimal combo route.</ol>
